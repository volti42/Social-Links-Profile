## My process
When you review my first two projects, you can see that, like many beginner designers, I used fixed values for width and height. I made the same mistake at the beginning of this project as well. When I started designing for mobile and tablet, the structure of my project was breaking due to the fixed values I assigned. In this project, I learned to use percentage values instead of fixed values. This allowed me to easily adjust my layouts for responsive design while trying to use minimal code. In summary, I learned to use Grid, Flexbox, and percentages in this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
Grid, Flexbox

### Continued development
I want to create more polished designs with JavaScript.
